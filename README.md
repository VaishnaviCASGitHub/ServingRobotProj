# ServingRobotProj

The project outlines the design and development of a Serving Robot which is
considered as a possible solution to address the lack of human resource and to
introduce Automation. The Human waiters are replaced by the Robots as
Servers and Waiters in cafes, restaurants and Hotels. The lack of human
resource can be addressed by automation through an electronically automated
system called “Serving Robot” which does the job of a Waiter, Server as well
for ordering food items and beverages.
